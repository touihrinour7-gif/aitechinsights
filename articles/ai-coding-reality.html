            </div>

            <div class="article-content">
                <p class="intro">Last month, a developer going by "moltbook" on Reddit did something that got the entire tech community talking: they built a Reddit clone specifically designed for bots—complete with bot accounts, API integration, and moderation tools—in <strong>less than a week</strong>.</p>

                <p>Not a toy. Not a proof of concept. A functional Reddit alternative, built by one person, using Claude Code as their primary development tool.</p>

                <p>The response on Hacker News was telling:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "How is it not at least 10x of what was achievable in pre-ai world?"
                </blockquote>

                <p>But underneath the awe, experienced developers started asking the uncomfortable questions:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "Granted he left the DB open to public, but some meat-powered startups did exactly the same few years ago."
                </blockquote>

                <p>This is the paradox of AI coding tools in 2025: they're genuinely transformative for certain tasks, but they're also being used to build things that were already possible—if significantly slower—before.</p>

                <p>So what's actually changed? And where do these tools still fail spectacularly?</p>

                <h2 id="what-ai-coding-assistants-actually-excel-at">What AI Coding Assistants Actually Excel At</h2>

                <p>After reading through hundreds of HN threads, Reddit discussions, and talking to developers using these tools daily, a clear picture emerges.</p>

                <p><strong>Where AI coding assistants genuinely shine:</strong></p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Boilerplate and glue code</strong>

                            <li>One-off scripts that you'd never spend time on otherwise</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Language translation</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"Convert this Python to TypeScript"</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>"Add JSDoc comments to all these functions"</li>
                            <li>"Generate a README from this code"</li>
                            <li>Writing API documentation</li>

                    <li><strong>Finding and fixing simple bugs</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Syntax errors</li>
                            <li>Type mismatches</li>
                            <li>Common implementation mistakes</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Learning new codebases</strong>
                        <ul>

                            <li>Generating summaries of complex files</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>A developer on HN captured the sentiment:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "I've probably got close to a year's worth of coding done in a month and a half. Busy work that would have taken me a day to look up, figure out, and write—boring shit like matplotlib illustrations—they are trivial now."
                </blockquote>

                <h2 id="where-ai-coding-assistants-still-fail">Where AI Coding Assistants Still Fail</h2>

                <p>Here's what the hype doesn't tell you: <strong>AI coding tools are still incredibly dangerous in production environments.</strong></p>

                <p>From HN discussions:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "All my coworkers use agents extensively in the backend and the amount of shit code, bad tests and bugs has skyrocketed."
                </blockquote>

                <p>Another developer in the medical technology space:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "In medicine, where our customer in some cases needs to validate the application's behavior extensively, it's a fucking disaster—very expensive iteration instead of doing it well upfront."
                </blockquote>

                <blockquote>
                    "It very much looks like it does, but it 100% does not [understand concurrency in Erlang/BEAM/OTP]. I would say it's an act of self-harm because it fundamentally doesn't understand concurrent systems."
                </blockquote>

                <h4 id="2-domain-specific-knowledge">2. Domain-specific knowledge</h4>

                <blockquote>
                    "There could be 1000s of examples in its training data of what you want, but if no one wrote a comment that accurately describes what that does..."
                </blockquote>

                <blockquote>
                    "AI doesn't know what you don't know. Experience teaches you that you only find most stuff by building/struggling; not sipping a soda while the AI blurts out potentially secure/stable code."
                </blockquote>

                <h4 id="4-edge-cases-and-error-handling">4. Edge cases and error handling</h4>

                <blockquote>
                    "I've seen a large increase in small bugs with more AI coding assistance."
                </blockquote>

                <h2 id="the-quality-vs-quantity-trade-off">The Quality vs. Quantity Trade-off</h2>

                <p>This is the uncomfortable truth that nobody wants to acknowledge:</p>

                <p><strong>AI coding assistants decrease code quality while increasing output quantity.</strong></p>

                <p>From HN:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "Several experiments have shown quality of output at every skill level drops. In many cases the quantity of output is good enough to compensate, but quality is extremely difficult to improve at scale. Beefing up QA to handle significantly more code of noticeably lower quality only goes so far."
                </blockquote>

                <p>Think about what this means for your organization:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>More code = more technical debt</li>
                    <li>More code = more surface area for bugs</li>
                    <li>More code = harder to maintain</li>
                    <li>More code = slower velocity over time</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The initial speed gain is real. But it compounds into a maintenance burden that can take <em>years</em> to unwind.</p>

                <h2 id="the-multiplier-effect-its-real-but">The Multiplier Effect (It's Real, But...)</h2>

                <p>There's a phrase that keeps coming up in discussions:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "AI is a multiplier of base skill."
                </blockquote>

                <p>This is the most honest framework for understanding these tools.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A -1x engineer (someone who writes code that creates more problems than it solves) using AI becomes a -5x engineer—producing bad code five times faster.</li>
                    <li>A 1x engineer becomes a 5x engineer—genuinely more productive.</li>
                    <li>A 10x engineer becomes a 50x engineer—absolutely transformative.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The tool magnifies whatever skill level you bring to the table. If you don't understand what the AI is producing, you're amplifying your own ignorance.</p>

                <p>Here's what the "10x productivity" claims don't include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Learning to write effective prompts is a skill that takes weeks to develop</li>
                    <li>Complex requirements require careful prompting, iteration, and clarification</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="2-code-review-burden">2. Code review burden</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Every line AI generates must be reviewed by a human</li>
                    <li>For a 10x output increase, you need 10x code review capacity</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>When AI code fails, it's harder to debug than human-written code</li>
                    <li>You don't have the mental model of "why this was written this way"</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The quality problems compound over time</li>

                </ul>

                <blockquote>
                    "If AI is only able to help me do tasks that are of low value, where I previously wouldn't have bothered—is it really saving me anything? Before where I'd simply ignore auxiliary tasks and focus on what matters, I'm now constantly detoured with them thinking 'it'll only take ten minutes.'"

                <h2 id="the-honest-assessment">The Honest Assessment</h2>

                <p>Here's what I'd tell a friend asking about AI coding assistants:</p>

                <p><strong>Yes, they're genuinely useful.</strong> I've used Claude Code extensively and it genuinely feels like "flying" compared to old development workflows.</p>

                <p><strong>No, they won't replace developers.</strong> But they will replace developers who can't work without hand-holding, and they'll make good developers dramatically more productive.</p>

                <p><strong>The hype is real, but the limitations are real too.</strong> The 10x productivity claims are achievable—for certain tasks, with certain developers, on certain codebases. For everything else, it's a mixed bag.</p>

                <p><strong>The real value is boring.</strong> It's not AGI. It's not replacing your engineering team. It's finally automating away the tedious work that made software engineering feel like a grind.</p>

                <h2 id="practical-advice">Practical Advice</h2>

                <p>If you're going to use AI coding assistants:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Start with low-risk projects</strong> — Personal projects, prototypes, internal tools</li>
                    <li><strong>Review everything</strong> — Don't ship AI code without thorough review</li>
                    <li><strong>Understand what you're shipping</strong> — If you can't explain it, don't deploy it</li>
                    <li><strong>Use them for learning, not just output</strong> — Ask "why" as often as "what"</li>
                    <li><strong>Set quality standards early</strong> — It's easier to maintain quality from day one than to fix it later</li>
                </ol>

                <p>If you're hiring developers:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Ask about their AI workflow</strong> — Do they understand limitations?</li>
                    <li><strong>Test their ability to review AI code</strong> — Can they spot AI-generated bugs?</li>
                    <li><strong>Evaluate their mental models</strong> — Do they understand what they're building?</li>
                    <li><strong>Watch for quality trends</strong> — Is code quality degrading as they use AI more?</li>
                </ol>

                <h2 id="the-bottom-line">The Bottom Line</h2>

                <p>The developer who built a Reddit clone in a week isn't lying. The tools are genuinely that powerful for certain tasks.</p>

                <p>But the developer who said "the amount of shit code and bugs has skyrocketed" isn't lying either. These tools have serious limitations that the marketing doesn't acknowledge.</p>

                <p>The developers who thrive will be the ones who understand both—the genuine power AND the real limitations—and deploy these tools appropriately.</p>

                <p>The rest will learn the hard way that shipping bad code fast is still shipping bad code.</p>
